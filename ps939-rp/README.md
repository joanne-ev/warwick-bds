# Current Report: A New Model Exploring Human Risk-Taking Responses to Diseases

## Abstract

Signal Detection Theory models how individuals should optimise isolated decision-making under uncertainty to maximise payoff. This theory supports the intuition that individuals are more risk-averse as danger increases. State-Dependent Detection Theory builds upon this theory by allowing individuals to make sequential (rather than isolated) decisions. Under certain conditions, this new state-dependent modelling can reverse the original findings of Signal Detection Theory. Applications beyond behavioural ecology, like human risk-taking in financial contexts, remain unexplored. Therefore, this report undergoes two phases of model development using financial reserves in an environment at risk of infection. The final model includes an additional option to remain at the current reserve level and new severity factors, such as survival after infection or unlucky infection despite correct choices. Results of the adapted model align more with Signal Detection Theory than with State-Dependent Detection Theory, and also reveal novel effects of parameters such as background mortality and unlucky infection on risk responses. Future work should extend the model to include autocorrelation and game theory.

# Project Details: Effects of a New Disease on Risk-Taking
Should the existence of a new disease increase or decrease the level of health risk that people are willing to take when it comes to contact with others? And how should the level of risk-taking change with time? The answer to the first question can seem counter-intuitive; if there were no vaccine on its way to protect against the new disease then, to return to normal life at some point, we would have to put ourselves at more risk than we needed to prior to the disease appearing (even with ‘herd immunity’ reducing the risk of the new disease somewhat). But, with a vaccine on its way, it can be better to wait (take less risk) rather than putting oneself in harm’s-way. If decisions will be made repeatedly, effects are often reversed from one-off decisions when the probability of danger changes (Trimmer et al. 2017, McNamara & Trimmer 2018). This project will build simple models of the phenomenon, using techniques like signal detection theory (one of the simplest theories, which will be covered in PS931), and focus on the outcomes that many will initially find counter-intuitive. We may then contrast the model predictions with data about attitudes to risk (e.g., using data relating to covid).
