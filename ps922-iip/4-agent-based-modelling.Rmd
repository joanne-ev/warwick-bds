## Schelling Rules

1.  Academics are arranged in a spatial grid

2.  Each academic looks at their four (horizontal and vertical) neighbours

3.  An economist is unhappy if they have \>1 psychologists as neighbours

    A psychologist is unhappy if they have \>1 economists as neighbours

4.  On each time cycle, a random unhappy economist exchanges position with a random unhappy psychologist

5.  Happy academics donâ€™t move

```{r Basic_Schelling_Function, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
### BASIC SCHELLING FUNCTION ###


schelling_basic <- function(nside_inp) {
  ## STEP 1: SET UP WORLD WITH RANDOMLY POSITIONED ACADEMICS
  nside <- nside_inp  ## Number of agents on each side of the matrix

  ### Create an nside-by-nside matrix of random numbers between 0 and 1
  rand_world <- matrix(runif(nside^2, 0, 1),   # Generates nside^2 random numbers from a uniform distribution
                       nside,                  # Number of rows
                       nside                   # Number of columns
                       )

  ### Assign agents to be either Psychologists (0) or Economists (1)
  world <- (rand_world > .5) * 1
  #### If agent in rand_world is more than 0.5 it is assigned TRUE otherwise it is assigned FALSE. The boolean is then multiplied by 1 to return a numeric value 1 (TRUE = Economist) or 0 (FALSE = Psychologist)

  #### Alternative code: world = round(rand_world)
  ##### Works similarly as the above (i.e., if greater than 0.5, the agent is rounded to 1 and is labelled an Economist)

  ## Set up a colourmap where green represents Psychologists and red represents Economists
  agent_cols <- c(rgb(0, 1, 0), rgb(1, 0, 0))


  ## STEP 2: HAVE ACADEMICS CHECK THEIR NEIGHBOURS

  ### Give these temporary variables high values just to satisfy the while condition
  n_sad_econs <- nside^2
  n_sad_psychs <- nside^2

  while( min( c(n_sad_econs, n_sad_psychs) ) > 50 ) {
    ### Calculate number of Economists surrounding each agent
    A <- circshift(world, c(1, 0))         # Shift one row down and wrap round
    B <- circshift(world, c(-1, 0))        # Shift one row up and wrap round
    C <- circshift(world, c(0, 1))         # Shift one col right and wrap round
    D <- circshift(world, c(0, -1))        # Shift one col left and wrap round
    n_econ <- A + B + C + D                # Now matrix `n_econ` has the number of Economists neighbours for each person in world


  ## STEP 3: IDENTIFY SAD ECONOMISTS AND PSCYHOLOGISTS (still in the while loop)

    ### Find sad Economists (i.e. < 3 Economists as neighbours ~ > 1 Psychologists as neighbours)
    sad_econs <- world * (n_econ < 3) * 1

    ### Find sad Psychologists (i.e. > 1 Economists as neighbours)
    sad_psychs <- abs(world - 1) * (n_econ > 1) * 1

    ### Count the number of sad Psychologists and Economists
    n_sad_econs <- sum(sad_econs)
    n_sad_psychs <- sum(sad_psychs)


  ## STEP 4: SWAP SAD ACADEMICS (still in the while loop)

    ### Choose a random sad Economist and change to be a Psychologist
    w <- which(sad_econs > 0, arr.ind = TRUE)              # Get the row and col indices (arr.ind = TRUE) of all sad Economists (sad_econs > 0)
    index <- ceiling(runif(1, 0, 1) * n_sad_econs)         # Choose a random sad Economist
    world[w[index, 1], w[index, 2]] <- 0                   # Change the Economist to a Psychologist

    ### Choose a random sad Psychologist and change to be an Economist
    w <- which(sad_psychs > 0, arr.ind = TRUE)            # Get the row and col indices of all sad Psychologists
    index <- ceiling(runif(1, 0, 1) * n_sad_psychs)       # Choose a random sad Economist
    world[w[index, 1], w[index, 2]] <- 1                  # Change the Economist to a Psychologist

  ## STEP 5: DRAW THE STATE OF THE WORLD
    
    image(world, col = agent_cols)
    Sys.sleep(0.2)      # Update the figure each time it goes round
